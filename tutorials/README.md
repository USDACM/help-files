Share your hard work with the rest of the world!

Save someone the headache you went through setting up your development environment or installing that library you needed for your project.  Save yourself the headache two years from now when you will have inevitably forgotton what you did!

No need to re-invent the wheel, though.  If you come across a great tutorial that answers all of your questions, don't copy it, just post a link.  If your tutorial borrows heavily on someone else's on the web, give them a shoutout and post a link to theirs at the top of your tutorial here.  The problem you/someone else face in the future may be different enough that you would want to see the other perspective anyway.
