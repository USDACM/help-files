The github help, and in particular the bootcamp, is very helpful.

!!!COMMIT FROM LINUX LAB!!!
Currently, the linux lab is using git version 1.7.1 so you might <will> have
some trouble pushing your commits to github.  To get around this, after you
clone a repository, go into:
    <repository>/.git/config
file and where it says
    "url = https://github.com/"....
    change that to
   https://<your username>@github.com/USDACM/<repository>.git
